<h3>ON YOUR FIRST VISIT</h3>

<p>On your first visit, Dr. Jason will want to find out about you and answer any questions you may have.   He will personally explain to you what chiropractic is about, how it can benefit you and your family and how the office works. </p></br>

<p>Then he will carefully analyze your spine for vertebral subluxations.   If any subluxations are found, Dr. Jason will gently begin to correct them through specific chiropractic adjustments. </p>

<h4>Appointments for a first visit are recommended, please call or email, but you can also walk in during open hours.</h4>

<h4><span class="vert">VERTEBRAL SUBLUXATION </span></h4>
<p>When a spinal bone gets misaligned from the various stresses of life, it interferes with the delicate nervous system.  This is called a Vertebral Subluxation.</p>

<p>Vertebral subluxations rob your body of <span class="sublife">LIFE</span>.  Your body cannot heal, function, perform or express life fully if there is a vertebral subluxation present. </p></br> <p>Chiropractors are the only professionals trained to locate, analyze and correct vertebral subluxations, and the only way you can know if you have a vertebral subluxation is to have your spine checked by a chiropractor.  The correction of a vertebral subluxation by a chiropractor is called an adjustment. </p>
